## Some important info
Deploying on local connected ios device and using images with *.svg as a reference will fail. "NET MAUI converts SVG files to PNG files. Therefore, when adding an SVG file to your . NET MAUI app project, it should be referenced from XAML or C# with a . png extension." https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/images/images?view=net-maui-8.0
